      "comment": "Immediately upon opening the box, the quality and care put into this timepiece was evident.  The watch has a slightly larger face than anticipated, and that is appreciated, since it sets this watch apart from some of the other brands that I own. The watch operates with perfectly smooth precision.  Most importantly, the design is extremely eye-catching.",

More for “show” than anything else. .Though. .some might find them helpful. It kind of makes this watch look a bit like a chronograph. .but it is not.",
